# Game Manager Cloud - Daemon

## Host, manage and monitor your Game Servers

**"Game Manager Cloud" is a web application to manage game servers — especially ARK: Ascended and ARK: Evolved servers.
You can host servers on your own dedicated machines, while allowing you to manage and organize all ark servers across
different
machines in one panel.**

### 👾 GMC Info

- **The Website**: Here, you can create your account and manage Ark servers with ease — no Windows server connection
  needed! [GMC WebPanel](https://gamemanager.cloud)
- **The GMC-Daemon**: This nifty program lets you manage Ark servers via the website, even on dedicated servers.
- **Install with Ease**: It's just like installing any other program.
- **Web Integration**: Easily add daemons to your account and manage Ark servers.
