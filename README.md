# GMC Early Access - Daemon

**"Game Manager Cloud" is a web application to manage game servers — especially ARK: Ascended servers. You can host
servers on your own dedicated machines, while allowing you to manage and organize all ark servers across different
machines in one panel.**

### 👾 GMC Info

- **The Website**: Here, you can create your account and manage Ark servers with ease — no Windows server connection
  needed!
- **The GMC-Daemon**: This nifty program lets you manage Ark: SA servers via the website, even on dedicated servers.
- **Install with Ease**: It's just like installing any other program.
- **Web Integration**: Easily add daemons to your account and manage Ark: SA servers.
- **Source Code Transparency**: We're all about openness, so we're publishing the daemon's source code for everyone to
  see. So you can see exactly what the daemon can do on your server.
- **Discord**: Join our Discord server to get help, talk to the community, and stay up to
  date. [Join our Discord](https://discord.gg/vJBc3evNwP)
